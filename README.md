# Kilix's Kotlin Snippets

This is just a collection of "snippets" that are meant to be
embedded directly into your project.

You may do so free of charge and without crediting me in any way, 
as long as you are aware that: 
<ul>
    <li>
        any files are subject to changes without prior notice.<br/>
        if you need any specific version, you can simply review previous commits
    </li>
    <li>
        contributions are appreciated, 
        but I do not promise to accept or even review 
        them in a timely manner or at all!
    </li>
    <li>
        I try to keep dependencies "upward only"
        (e.g. package ansi uses the unnamed package, but not vice versa).
        But again, no promises, that this is or will be the case in any given version.
    </li>
</ul>

happy coding!
